# GlucoseBar Privacy Policy

## Information and Use

GlucoseBar does not collect or use any of your personal data. The data that it does collect (authentication credentials for CGM sources) is only stored locally on your computer, as is the glucose data retrieved from CGM sources. GlucoseBar does not access any other Internet entities than the CGM source you have configured.

## Future Changes

This privacy policy is subject to change, however it is unlikely. If it does change, I will strive to include a notice in the following update of GlucoseBar. There are cases where that is not possible, so please check back regularly to familiarize yourself with any modifications that may be made.
