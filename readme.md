# GlucoseBar

GlucoseBar is a macOS 14+ Menu Bar application for monitoring your or your loved ones CGM readings at a glance.

## CGM Providers

Name | Supported | Notes
----|----|----
Nightscout | ✅ | Uses APIv3, and thus does not make use of your API secret, but instead a token
Dexcom Share | ✅ |
Libre LinkUp | ⏳️ | Basic functionality is in, but I need testing help from an actual Libre user.

If you have requests for any other CGM data providers, please get in touch through a ticket.
